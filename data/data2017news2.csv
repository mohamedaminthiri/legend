In some circumstances it may also lead to help seeking behavior.  There is limited evidence for which specific characteristics of media reports mediate these phenomena and there is little Canadian research on the topic.  This study examined the relationship between potentially harmful and helpful elements of print and online media reports about suicide in 13 major publications in the Toronto media market and suicide deaths in Toronto (2011-2014).  Specifically, it assessed for a link between specific types of reporting and suicide deaths within the 7 days after publication.  It found that from 2011-2014, there were 6,367 articles with suicide as the major focus.  There were 947 suicide deaths in Toronto over the same period.  Elements most strongly, independently associated with increased suicides were a statement that suicide is inevitable, articles about asphyxia other than by hanging or car exhaust, about suicide by jumping from a building, about suicide pacts and that included the suicide method in the headline.  Elements most strongly, independently associated with decreased suicides were negative judgments about the deceased within the article, articles about railway and cutting/stabbing deaths, and about murder-suicide.  This large study identified significant associations between several specific elements of media reports and suicide deaths.  It suggests that reporting on suicide can have a meaningful impact on suicide deaths and that journalists and media outlets/organizations should carefully consider the specific content of reports prior to publication.",,,

A sulphur mustard gas explosion was the culprit and he continues to endure significant keloid scarring to his head and neck, which of course now produces more emotional pain than other forms. He is eleven and gets teased by other children because of the way he looks. He has attempted suicide three times. And for now, he has been rescued by family three times. I learned about Yousef my first days in mission and quite honestly the story gutted me. I told my colleague immediately that Òthis story needs to be heardÓ.

I want the poem to probe the readerÕs perceptions about mental illness: once the reader discovers that the true diagnosis is mental illness rather than cancer, does it change your appreciation for the severity of the problem? Does it make you feel less concerned with the subjectÕs affliction or attitudes? Does it feel disrespectful to cancer patients? Most of all: what causes us to feel this way? For an institution that prides itself for taking care of patients, we donÕt always take the best care of ourselves. Worse, we encourage the same bad habits to manifest in others. The substance use, the signs of physical and mental strain, we all know itÕs there and yet itÕs so hard to combat. The culture of medicine itself disables us: the idea that admitting our humanity makes us weak, the length and depth of training required, the perpetual stress of fighting a medical system to give our patients what we know they need.

We often think of placebo controls in trials as simple, but they come in different shapes and sizes, have different ingredients, and range from fake pills and injections to fake surgery. And different placebos can have different effects on patients. For example, studies show that many placebos donÕt appear similar enough to the ÔrealÕ treatments they are supposed to imitate. If they donÕt, then participants in the trial will know they are taking a placebo, and could drop out of the trial or have lower expectations (thinking ÔIÕm not going to get better because IÕm just taking the placeboÕ). These lower expectations can lead to worse outcomes in some trials Ê- such as in those of drugs for treating pain or depression. In this article, we discuss these and other examples of placebo controls that are not good controls. To know whether a placebo control is a good control or not, we need to know all the components of it. Unfortunately, most trials donÕt tell us these details. This means that we canÕt sure how much the treatment that is being trialled actually helps or harms people. This articles shows that all of the people involved in doing trials need to fully describe the components of the placebo control being used so that we have accurate research to inform decisions about treatments.",,,

I had done all I could to keep him alive, and although he wanted me to provide a pill for the end, I couldnÕt do that . Although his wishes were clear, in the end we could not do more than get him into a hospice for end of life care and discontinue his medications. It raises the point that we may have firm ideas about how we want to die, but the reality of instituting such wishes is much more difficult when that person is no longer in mental control. I suggest that we use media to build a clear picture of what we want and donÕt want, so that when doctors and health care providers meet us at our worst, they can access that media and see what we wanted when we were at our best. Not everyone gets an end of life diagnosis that allows one to be sentient right to the end, diseases that rob the mind cause difficulties for caregivers when determining end of life decisions.",,,

He underwent endovascular management with placement of self expandable stent.BCS occurs secondary to in-situ vascular thrombosis, extrinsic compression by adjacent tumor or its invasion, and idiopathic membranous obstruction. The membranous or the short segment obstruction of the IVC is the common variety in Asia. In western country thrombotic obstruction is the common cause. The typical triad of BCS is abdominal pain, hepatomegaly and ascites. The clinical presentation of BCS depends on the extent and rapidity of the hepatic-vein occlusion. Doppler ultrasound is the initial investigation of choice. Other investigatory modalities include contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The mode of management varies according to the extent of disease and anatomical variety of BCS. Medical therapy consists of diuretic therapy to control ascites and anticoagulation therapy for prevention of thrombus extension. The relief of venous outflow obstruction can be done with techniques like percutaneous thrombolysis, venous angioplasty with or without stenting, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt and surgical shunts. Liver transplantation may be needed in rare instances.",,,

He was treated with topical ketoconazole cream for 2 weeks without any improvement. Physical examination showed redness and fine scaling on the glans penis. Fungal cultures of scrapings from the glans were negative. Skin biopsy showed parakeratosis, Munro microabscesses, and acanthosis in the epidermis, which were consistent with psoriasis vulgaris. The patient received tacrolimus 0.1% ointment twice daily and the lesions were resolved after 3 weeks. He then applied it twice weekly, which prolonged flare-free interval for six months.Up to 63% of psoriasis patients have genital involvement. But psoriasis limited to the glans penis is rare, affecting only 2-5% of psoriasis patients. Patients may experience poor quality of life and sexual repression. They usually lack the typical presentation of psoriasis, which more often leads to misdiagnosis as other inflammatory diseases or, more importantly, sexually transmitted infections. Glans psoriasis is difficult to treat as glans skin is very thin and sensitive. The first-line topical agents for psoriasis vulgaris, such as corticosteroids and calcipotriol, are not suited to glans psoriasis due to their local side reactions. Topical tacrolimus, an immunosuppressant, is significantly effective and has good tolerability for inverse psoriasis on face, genitals, and intertriginous areas. Therefore, it may be more suited to a patient with chronic or recurrent glans psoriasis. ",,,

Over that period of time, there was a 27% reduction in the rate of CDI across Canada and significant changes in C. difficile strains circulating in hospitals. CDI caused by the NAP1 strain, previously implicated in many of the most significant outbreaks, was associated with higher mortality. While the NAP1 strain remains the dominant strain, it has become much less common and is being replaced by other strains.

Over this period, a variety of screening programs have met these criteria and contributed to significant reductions in adverse outcomes through early detection and treatment. Yet, until now, there have been few efforts to evolve and refine Wilson and JungnerÕs 10 principles, and to go beyond the key conditions necessary to consider screening to the key elements necessary to ensure that a screening program is successful. Dobrow and colleagues sought to assess whether attempts had been made to update Wilson and JungnerÕs criteria in the period since they were published, gather that literature, and ask experts in the field to critique these updates, consolidate, and refine them. The original 10 criteria are now 12 consolidated principles that address these criteria, but also the conditions that must be in place for screening to be successfully implemented and maintained at the population level. The update also includes attention to patient autonomy, and also being sensitive to the needs of individuals to be fully informed about what to expect from screening.  Th refined criteria are an important contribution, insofar as it reaffirms the important criteria that must be met to initiate screening, but also the criteria that must be met to ensure that programs are high performing. A review of these criteria reveals that much work remains to be done for many screening programs to achieve their fullest potential.",,,

His sketches capture pivotal clinical moments. Writing in Literature and Medicine, Mary Winkler describes Blum as a physician who sees Òevents for artÓ in his patientsÑÒindividual personalities who act in a human drama of courage, despair, humor, pettiness, and death.Ó Blum worries that the displacement of paper by the electronic medical record and the diminishment of narrative in favor of checking boxes is irreversibly harming the patient-physician relationship. He uses his sketches to learn something beyond the compass of technological medicine. A simple sketch enables him to better recall a patientÕs occupation, children, personality, joys, and sorrows. The stories reflect recurring themes: aging, anxiety, bereavement, obesity, joblessness, family disruption, homelessness, worries about contracting diseases, and the very fear of being a patient. The sketches remind us that the patient is more than a collection of symptoms. She or he is a person who lives in a community, exists within a family, and is replete with the scars of what has gone before in her or his life. The visual and textual vignettes in this presentation provide insights into the character of patients and how they feel about their illnesses. BlumÕs reflective drawing evokes the richness of medical practice and deepens our empathic understanding of our patients.",,,

Early detection of bleeding by CT scan is critical to good outcomes, however, CT scans should be used judiciously as they deliver radiation to the brain. Currently, there is uncertainty around which children who are symptomatic after a minor head injury need to undergo computed tomography (CT). We previously developed a decision rule comprised of seven clinical features (the CATCH rule) that predicted with high sensitivity those children requiring neurosurgical intervention and those with trauma to the brain seen on CT scan. In this study we tested this rule in a further 4060 children with blunt head trauma presenting to nine pediatric emergency departments across Canada. We found that the seven-item rule was very good but not 100% sensitive in identifying children with neurosurgical intervention. Through further analysis we refined the rule to an eight-variable rule (the CATCH2 rule) that was 100% sensitive for detecting children requiring neurosurgical intervention and 99% sensitive in detecting children with any brain trauma on CT. The next step is to further test the rule in an implementation study that assesses the clinical impact of the rule on a new set of patients. This rule will assist physicians in making decisions regarding immediate CT imaging, prompt referral to a centre with CT scanning availability or need for continued close observation in the emergency department.",,,

They have a higher risk of heart disease, diabetes, and falls. Because of these factors, data from paramedic services shows that they call 911 more often. Community Paramedicine at Clinic (CP@clinic) is a drop-in community-based program, created to prevent diabetes, heart disease, and falls in this population. CP@clinic is implemented by paramedics who are trained to do health assessments, health education, accurate blood pressure measurement, and refer program participants to community resources to improve their health. Information collected from CP@clinic is sent to participantsÕ family doctors with their consent. This program was tested in four subsidized seniorsÕ apartment-buildings in a large urban community in Canada. We evaluated whether the program could decrease 911 calls from older adult residents of buildings with CP@clinic compared to similar apartment-buildings. We also compared the quality of life and health practices of residents in these buildings to those without CP@clinic. The results show that fewer 911 calls came from buildings with CP@clinic.  Residents who attended CP@clinic had improved quality of life, reduced risk of diabetes and decreased blood pressure  over multiple visits. The first study to rigorously evaluate a community paramedicine program in Canada, we conclude that the CP@clinic program lowers 911 calls, improves health risk-factors, and improves quality of life of older adults living in subsidized housing buildings. With increasing numbers of seniors, a scale-up of CP@clinic in subsidized housing across Canada has great potential to substantially improve health and positively impact the Canadian health system.",,,

But it took another seven years for the first face transplant to even be attempted.  In this essay, I explain the gap between technical capability and execution.  While there were robust objections to the surgery based on the risks posed by the anti-rejection medication, the major barriers were social, having to do with the special status of the face as an index to identity, and conceptual, having to do with resistance to understanding facelessness and social death as a legitimate health risk. One of the unsettling Ð and fundamentally important Ð things about face transplant surgery is that it insists on an expanded definition of what constitutes health and wellness, and what can be done to achieve it.  At the same time, we need to examine biases against people with facial disfigurement that are so significant they actually create risks and challenges akin to death.  Rather than developing new ways of encountering others that looks beyond appearance, instead we rely on surgical procedures to make it easier to look at people face-to-face.  What it would be like to look at people face-to-faceless?  Face transplant surgery is one alternative to social death.  Surely there are others.",,,

Recent evidence reveals a small but serious risk of developing new spine fractures after stopping this drug. This article describes the medical information that led to denosumab being approved in Canada in 2010 and reassuring 10 year drug safety while on medication. Canadian physicians are prescribing this medication in increasing numbers, but patients may be stopping denosumab after a few doses or not taking the drug on the recommended schedule every six months.  Initial reports showed that patients had a fall in the bone density they had gained, once the drug was stopped. Recent case reports and follow-up of patients from a large study of denosumab in older women with osteoporosis revealed a small but increased risk for rapidly developing new, often multiple, spine fractures in patients who stopped taking denosumab. This occurred as soon as 8 months following the last injection. Bone researchers and specialists have called for physicians and patients to be made aware of the potential risk of multiple ÒreboundÓ fractures when denosumab is stopped. When prescribing denosumab, physicians should consider the patientÕs ability to take the medication regularly. Patients should not stop denosumab without seeing their doctor. Patients already taking denosumab who are considering stopping therapy should see their physicians to discuss the merits of either replacing it with another osteoporosis medication or continuing denosumab treatment until there is more information about how best to go off it safely.

","Obtaining research ethics approval is an important part of health research conducted with human subjects. Increasingly, researchers undertake multicentre studies, which can require them to seek approvals from a number of research ethics boards (REBs). Many researchers have complained about variability in decisions made by REBs, long time delays, and costs associated with obtaining ethics approval. Attempts have been made to reduce variation and delays but no national framework covering all types of health research exists. In this absence, provincial initiatives have been set up, but obtaining ethical review for the conduct of national and international multicentre studies remains difficult. In order to truly harmonise ethics review in Canada, national leadership is required to drive change that is both evidence-based and responsive to criticisms of ethics review.",,,

Against this backdrop, the Canadian Research Initiative in Substance Misuse (CRISM) has published an evidence-based guideline on the management of opioid use disorder. This timely publication offers succinct guidance for physicians regarding the pharmacologic management of patients with opioid use disorder. At a time when a minority people who need treatment for opioid use disorder receive it, the current Canadian guideline moves the narrative in the correct direction by clearly stating that it is intended for all frontline providers, Òwith or without specialized experience in addiction treatment.Ó It is these frontline providers who are vitally important to decrease the existing treatment gap. The messaging is clear regarding several key elements. First, pharmacotherapy is unequivocally the evidence-based first-line treatment for opioid use disorder. Second, withdrawal management alone should be avoided and is associated with relapse, morbidity, and death. Finally, psychosocial interventions should not be viewed as a mandatory component of treatment.  The critical next steps, at a national and international level, are to increase provider education regarding recognition and management of opioid use disorder and chronic pain; to reduce stigma associated with substance use disorders; to decrease provider barriers to prescribing opioid agonist treatment; to improve medication prescription coverage and increase access to care; to expand access to harm reduction modalities; and to encourage ongoing research into best practices for the prevention and treatment of opioid use disorder.",,,

#ketoacidosis
#NOFIGS","SGLT-2 inhibitor is a relatively new class of anti-diabetic medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2013 for treatment of type 2 diabetes. SGLT-2 inhibitor blocks glucose reabsorption in the kidney, which leads to loss of glucose in the urine. Increasing number of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis cases have been reported in patients taking this drug. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) usually presents with elevated blood glucose level. However, many patients with DKA while on an SGLT-2 inhibitor presented with near-normal glucose values, which potentially delayed the recognition and treatment of DKA. Risk factors include intercurrent illnesses, surgery, decreased carbohydrate intake, dehydration, insulin deficiency, excessive alcohol intake and latent autoimmune diabetes in adults. Patients should be counseled regarding the risk factors and symptoms of DKA, and if feeling unwell, they should check for urine or serum ketones, even if blood sugar is relatively low (²14 mmol/L). If ketones are present, SGLT-2 inhibitor should be withheld, hydration needs to be maintained and insulin supplementation has to be adjusted. When the DKA has resolved and the precipitant has been removed, the SGLT-2 may be restarted. If no other cause for DKA was identified, patients should not restart treatment with any SGLT-2 inhibitors to avoid recurrences of ketosis. However, the decision to restart any SGLT-2 inhibitor after an episode of DKA still remains controversial. ",,,

CanMEDS, the competency-based framework was developed in the 1990s and sprang from the Educating Future Physicians for Ontario (EFPO) project. However, little attention has been given to the relationship between EFPO and the 1986 Ontario doctorsÕ strike Ð the longest physiciansÕ strike in Canada. This paper revisits the strike - itÕs causes and consequences - and argues that the vision of competency-based medical education was a response to the damaged reputation of Ontario physicians following the unsuccessful strike. 

Or a more concise statement if that is more appropriate:

","¥ Screening decisions, whether made at clinical or population levels, are complex and require consideration of many factors.
¥ Fifty years ago, Wilson and Jungner published ÒPrinciples and practice of screening for diseaseÓ, a seminal document that highlighted ten principles that should be considered when making a screening decision.  
¥ Although the Wilson and Jungner principles are remarkably enduring, many attempts to modify or create new screening principles have been made over the ensuing five decades.
¥ We analyzed the Wilson and Jungner principles along with 40 sets of principles (including 367 unique principles) that we identified (through systematic review and a consensus process with international screening experts), which ultimately led to the establishment of 12 consolidated principles for screening
¥ These 12 consolidated principles maintain focus on disease/condition principles (e.g., relative importance and burden of the disease/condition; who should be targeted for screening) and test/intervention principles (e.g., characteristics of screening ÔtestsÕ; interpretation of screening test results; who should be targeted for different types of post-screening intervention), but provide more emphasis on program/system principles (e.g., characteristics of screening ÔprogramsÕ; economic evaluation; performance management).
¥ An implication of this shift in emphasis is that a broader range of evidence is relevant and a broader range of experts and stakeholders can help to inform the assessment and integration of a broader evidence base to inform screening guidelines for clinicians and screening programs for population health leaders.  
¥ These 12 consolidated principles represent a comprehensive and iterative modernization of guidance to inform population-based screening decisions.

@queensuim","This report describes the case of a 79-year old man in Southeastern Ontario who presented
to hospital with five days of fevers, headache, nausea and vomiting. Two weeks earlier
while in the forest near his home, he found a tick attached to his skin. Blood tests showed
that he had low platelets and white blood cells. Testing was performed which confirmed a
diagnosis of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA). This is an infection acquired from
ticks infected with the bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum. He was treated with two
weeks of the oral antibiotic doxycycline and recovered well.
This report documents an account of HGA acquired within Ontario. The first report of HGA
in humans was in 1994 and the first published report in Canada was in 2009. Populations
of ticks may be migrating North in recent years, changing the spread of infections like HGA.
The tick that spreads Anaplasama phagocytophilum also spreads Borrelia burgdorferi, the
bacterium that causes Lyme disease. The clinical presentation of the two diseases shares
similarities, so it can be challenging to discern the two. Typically, with Lyme disease there
is a bulls-eye like rash at the site of the tick bite, and most basic blood work is usually
normal. With HGA, rash is less common, and laboratory abnormalities like low platelets and
low white blood cell count are more common.
To further study and understand the spread of HGA, it may be useful for provincial public
health agencies to record cases of the emerging disease.",,,

","Cesarean sections are often required for the safe delivery of a neonate or for a motherÕs well-being. Considered a very safe procedure, one rare but serious consequence is having the placenta in a future pregnancy implant over the scar and then invade into the uterus. This condition is called placenta accreta and it occurs in approximately 1 out of 1000 deliveries. The most severe form of this condition is called placenta percreta, where the placenta invades through the uterus and into the abdominal cavity or surrounding organs. 

We present a case of a woman who required a classical Cesarean section for the delivery of a pre-term neonate. A classical Cesarean section differs from a regular Cesarean in that an incision is made higher on the body of the uterus through the thick muscular wall. This is often the only way to deliver very pre-term neonates as there is not enough room on the uterus to make a usual horizontal incision. When the woman in our case had her next pregnancy, the placenta invaded through the prior Cesarean section scar which was placed high on the uterus. This was a very unusual complication and required a specific surgical plan in order to ensure a safe delivery for both the mother and her baby. 

When placenta percreta occurs, the safest treatment is to deliver the neonate shortly before term by Cesarean section. Immediately afterwards, the uterus is removed, called a hysterectomy. This prevents life threatening bleeding to the mother because the placenta cannot be detached once it has invaded deeply into the uterus.

","Health promotion is the domain of social, economic and environmental ministries, whereas medical ministries treat illness more than they prevent it.  As a result, the WHO is encouraging governments to embrace the concept of Health in All Policies.  This concept illuminates that increased medical spending is not unambiguously good for population health when social spending does not keep pace. So physicians should anticipate that containment of future compensation increases and/or closure of tax advantages for doctors will promote population health by preserving funds for government agencies that focus on income, child care, housing, transit, the environment, etc.

Healthy social spending should prioritize fair levels of investment for young and old alike.  Governments must be mindful of the risks to health promotion for younger generations that follow from policy decisions to grow spending on medical care and retirement income for the aging population without collecting sufficient revenue to pay for those increases.  

A commitment to health in all policies also invites analysis of public decisions that shape major costs of living, like housing prices that have left behind the incomes of many people.  In such cases, health in all policies does not require more spending, so much as it requires changes to the housing market via zoning policies that permit more suitable supply, and/or tax policies that discourage harmful demand.  The latter is consistent with the health in all policies logic that governments should collect revenue by taxing more what harms health (like home prices decoupled from earnings) while taxing less what promotes it (like higher earnings for the typical citizen).

A long list of both benign and serious conditions can cause a pleural effusion, and therapeutic interventions may be required even before a diagnosis is established. But the necessary tools to conduct the investigations and alleviate symptoms are often not available in a primary care setting, and there is insufficient scientific evidence to guide decision-making in many areas. This article therefore offers a pragmatic approach to the evaluation of patients with a pleural effusion for the non-respiratory specialist physician. It focuses on the identification of patients requiring an urgent evaluation and describes the initial investigations needed to better characterize the cause of the effusion by exploring their interpretation and limitations. It also provides guidance for front line physicians on when to refer for specialist evaluation. ",,,

Despite their impressive efficacy rates, pregnancies do arise with an IUD in utero. Pregnancies complicated by retained IUDs are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, specifically early miscarriage and preterm delivery. Current evidence supports the removal of IUDs in pregnancy at the earliest gestational age possible. Evidence shows decreases in both miscarriage and preterm delivery rates following IUD removal in earlyÊpregnancy.Ê When the IUD strings are visible on exam, removal is undertaken in the usual fashion by grasping and pulling on the strings.Ê This can be performed by a patient s primary care provider. When the strings are not visible or retrievable on exam, hysteroscopic retrieval, or ultrasound-guided retrieval with grasping forceps, can be performed for IUD removal. In this circumstance, patients should be referred to a gynecologist with experience in advanced hysteroscopy, or a maternal fetal medicine specialist with expertise in ultrasound guided procedures, for the consideration of IUD removal.",,,

An estimated 2,458 overdose deaths were recorded in 2016 and the numbers could easily double in 2017.  The crisis has exposed serious gaps in the drug treatment system and harm reduction programming across Canada.  While people using opioids have been accessing their drugs through illegal channels for decades, it is only in the past few years that the illegal drug supply has become increasingly dominated by potent synthetic opioids Ð mainly fentanyl.  Making the situation worse is a renewed interest in reducing opioid prescribing that has further squeezed the street supply.  People who have been using opioids for many years are suddenly in grave danger of being poisoned by a single lethal purchase.  While naloxone distribution, harm reduction programs, and expanded access to drug treatment are critical in the response to the overdose crisis, they will have a limited impact as long as people are driven to purchase drugs that are unpredictable and potentially lethal. The pragmatic approach to the current crisis is to introduce a regulated program that provides access to safer and reliable opioids.  A program to supply injectable heroin and/or hydromorphone to a small number of chronic opioid users has been proven to be highly successful in Vancouver. Unfortunately it is completely impractical to scale up an injectable hydromorphone program that would reach the thousands of people who are at imminent risk of overdose. An untested but compelling argument could be made for a large scale-up of hydromorphone pills that are cheap and readily available.  Initiating a rapid scale up of an opioid distribution program would require some regulatory changes, a monitoring and evaluation strategy, along with a general shift in how we are approaching the opioid overdose epidemic.  At this point our options are very limited. ",,,

How to recognize this condition, what patient population is at greatest risk and which medications lead to medication overuse headache is very important knowledge for general practitioners. Once recognized, a useful skill set on how to treat medication overuse headache can lead to reduction in frequency and severity of headaches for patients, dramatically improving their quality of life and daily productivity.

When influenza vaccination fails to prevent influenza illness, vaccination may still have an additional effect by reducing influenza severity. 
We carried out a multicentre case-control study in elderly patients hospitalized during two influenza seasons in Spain. Severe hospitalized influenza cases were defined as patients who required intensive care unit (ICU) admission or who died. We evaluated the effect of the influenza vaccine of the current and three previous seasons on preventing influenza hospitalizations and reducing influenza severity. 
Repeated influenza vaccination showed a protective effect of 31% in preventing non-severe influenza hospitalizations, 74% in preventing ICU admissions, and 70% in preventing mortality. Among hospitalized patients with influenza, repeated vaccination reduced the risk of severe outcomes by 55%.
Repeated influenza vaccination was highly effective in preventing severe influenza in the elderly. This high effect may be explained by the combination of influenza hospitalizations prevented and the reduced severity of hospitalized influenza patients in whom vaccination did not prevent influenza illness. Since severe cases may be prevented by these two mechanisms, the vaccine effect against severe influenza may be greater than against mild cases and the benefit of influenza vaccination may be greater than that estimated in previous studies. The prevention of severe influenza was mainly observed in patients repeatedly vaccinated in both the current and previous seasons, which reinforces the recommendation of annual influenza vaccination in the elderly.

Cancers of the larynx (voice box) are the cause of hoarseness 1-2% of the time. In cases where the cause is unclear, surveys have shown that many health care providers will treat with a trial of medications targeting infection, reflux or allergy. When the cause of hoarseness is unclear, research has not shown any benefit to trials of treatment and this practice should be avoided. 
If a patient has a hoarse voice for more than three months, the patient should be referred to an Otolaryngology-Head and Neck surgeon to have their vocal cords visualized. Visualization is usually done with a small flexible scope and will help identify the cause of hoarseness. Over half of cancers of the larynx originate on the vocal cords and hoarseness is an early sign of disease. These cancers are easily seen when the vocal cords are visualized. Some patients have concerning features in their history and should be referred even more urgently. Concerning features include: a history of smoking, steadily worsening hoarseness, difficult or painful swallowing, noisy or difficult breathing, and ear pain. 
Outcomes in cancer of the larynx depend on how advanced the cancer is, and how long it takes to get diagnosed. Cancers diagnosed at an early stage have higher rates of survival, and better quality of life for survivors. Even in early cancers, delays in referral have been associated with poorer outcomes.

Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography confirms a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. She is prescribed rivaroxaban (15 mg twice daily for 21 days followed by 20 mg daily). She has taken a combined oral contraceptive pill (OCP) since age 17. Her family physician sees her in clinic and considers alternative treatment options, duration of treatment, and how to reduce the risk of future thromboembolic events.
This  Decisions  paper addresses the optimal treatment for this woman s PE, how to manage her OCP, duration of anticoagulation, screening for hypercoagulable disorders, and address concerns around potential future pregnancies.
Ultimately, direct oral anticoagulants, or DOACs, are the preferred treatment for acute VTE in patients without cancer. As long as she is anticoagulated, it is safe and preferred for her to continue taking the OCP to avoid menorrhagia and subjecting the fetus to unstudied medication. Anticoagulation should continue for a minimum 3 months; prolonged anticoagulation depends on the risk of recurrent VTE. Finally, should the patient become pregnant, she should receive VTE prophylaxis during the antepartum and for six weeks postpartum.

For Facebook, please use CIUSSSCentreOuest.","Because of depressionÕs high burden, it is crucial to accurately estimate prevalence. Conducting diagnostic interviews to properly classify depression, however, is expensive. Thus, researchers increasingly rely upon self-report screening questionnaires, which are completed independently by research participants, to estimate depression prevalence in different groups, such as among patients with a particular medical disease. Our analysis found that most recent publications on depression prevalence used screening questionnaires rather than diagnostic interviews.
Screening questionnaires, however, are not designed to definitively determine whether depression is present. Rather, they are designed to cast a wide net and identify a large pool of people who may have depression, so that healthcare professionals can follow-up. Our analysis demonstrated that when researchers take the shortcut of using screening questionnaires, instead of diagnostic interviews, to estimate depression prevalence, prevalence is substantially exaggerated. In one example, depression prevalence from 183 studies of medical students was 27% based on screening questionnaires, but only 9% based on a diagnostic interview, similar to the rate of young adults in the general population.
Our analysis also demonstrated that screening questionnaires exaggerate prevalence most when true prevalence is low. Prevalence is exaggerated by 2-3 times when true prevalence is under 10%, but only very minimally when true prevalence is high (e.g., over 20%). Thus, screening questionnaires blur distinctions between low- and high-prevalence groups.
Researchers must use diagnostic interviews to accurately estimate prevalence. A two -stage estimation method that combines screening questionnaires and diagnostic interviews can reduce resource requirements and generate valid prevalence estimates.",,,

","In this essay, the author considers some of the challenges and limitations of the use of narratives in medical practice and medical education. Rather than the conventional focus on the details of the story itself, or the interaction between storyteller and listener, Dr. Berkhout argues that greater attention needs to be paid to what can be understood as the Òrhetorical spaceÓ that surrounds narrative in medicine: the power differentials, and the social, political, and historical context that a story emerges from. Linking this to feminist and queer scholarship in narrative studies, Berkhout suggests that this could make for better listening and better medicine.",,,

","This report describes a striking clinical image of Leishmania in a Syrian refugee from Aleppo, who recently immigrated to Canada. The described histopathological microscopic findings provide important clinicopathological correlation for these lesions. We also highlight the efficacy of liquid nitrogen cryotherapy, which is inexpensive and readily accessible treatment, for the localized form of this skin infection.  Importantly, this short report highlights the ÒFive LÕsÓ differential diagnosis for red dermal plaques on the face, which is commonly used in dermatology and is described in highly-specialized dermatology literature, but unfortunately is not at all known to physicians outside of our specialty. As highlighted in the paper, the Five LÕs include lupus erythematosus/tumid lupus, lymphocytic infiltrate of Jessner, lymphoma cutis, lymphocytoma cutis, and polymorphous light eruption and in some instances leprosy, leishmania and lues (syphilis) should also be considered. Indeed, we have discovered that the ÒFive LÕsÓ differential diagnosis, while being a powerful diagnostic tool, is Òthe best kept secretÓ in general medicine. We believe that knowing the ÒFive LÕsÓ differential diagnosis is a powerful tool for all physicians who on routine basses observe patientsÕ faces during a clinic visit or a hospital stay (i.e., most practicing physicians). This tool will provide a powerful knowledge on how to approach a patient, who may have these types of indurated plaques on the face. Knowing this differential diagnoses also underscores the importance of recognizing these lesions and directing patients for further evaluation and a skin biopsy.

Regulatory frameworks for orphan drugs have been created in more than 25 countries over the past 30 years.  Canada remains one of the few developed countries without such a regulatory framework.  
     Canadians with rare neuromuscular diseases including spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) have witnessed a dramatic increase in clinical trials and, for the first time, approval of disease-modifying therapies.  The emergence of these novel therapies has emphasized the need for a Canadian orphan drug framework. 
     Canadian patients with rare diseases require timely access to safe and effective treatments.   Canada must explore novel incentives and invest in our countryÕs existing strengths.  Since provincial health care budgets are allocating a growing proportion of their expenditure toward pharmaceutical costs, a national strategy is needed to balance short-term accessibility with long-term financial sustainability.  As such, Canadian incentives for drug development and regulatory approval must extend beyond tax credits and the reward of high prices.  A Ômade in CanadaÕ orphan drug strategy could ensure that the government engages early in the drug development process.   By investing in existing Canadian infrastructure during the ÔinfancyÕ of a given drugÕs development, governments could position themselves to negotiate potential price-caps or price reductions.  
     CanadaÕs orphan drug framework must involve consultation with patients and families with rare diseases, clinicians, clinician-investigators and industry representatives.  As physicians who care for children with rare diseases, we call upon the Government of Canada to fulfill itsÕ 2012 commitment and develop a Ômade in CanadaÕ orphan drug framework to improve patientsÕ access to emerging therapies.

Under the system, all eligible workers in Quebec are required to have private insurance for prescription drug costs and all other residents are required to purchase drug coverage from the provincial government. The system increased access to insurance for previously uninsured working-age populations. It thereby increased access to medicines for working-age residents of Quebec. However, access to medicines in Quebec is still lower than in comparable high-income countries with universal systems of health and pharmaceutical coverage. QuebecÕs private-public system of drug insurance brought with it new and steadily increasing deductibles, co-insurance rates, and premiums. These charges had negative consequences on access to medicine among beneficiaries of QuebecÕs formerly more-comprehensive public plans: most notably among Quebecers aged 65 and older. The premiums, deductibles, and co-insurance under private and public drug plans in Quebec represent a greater proportion of income for lower-income households than for high-income ones. This makes the regime a regressive means of financing prescription drug costs in the province. Despite hopes to the contrary, QuebecÕs regime increased taxpayer-financed drug expenditures and significantly increased employer- and household-financed expenditures. If pharmaceutical costs in Quebec had grown at the same rate as they did in the rest of Canada rate since 1997, Quebecers would be spending $1.7 billion less per year on prescription drugs than they do today. If costs in Quebec had fallen to levels observed in countries with universal, single-payer drug coverage systems, Quebecers would be saving billions more each year.",,,

Some suggest that health care spending is an inefficient way to improve population health, pointing to research on the social determinants of health and their role in preventing poor health outcomes. International research shows that increased spending on social services can improve population health, but with CanadaÕs public health care system itÕs unclear whether that holds here. We study government spending and health outcomes in Canadian provinces using 31 years of data. We wanted to know the influence of social spending on health outcomes like potentially avoidable mortality, infant mortality, and life expectancy. We find that social spending, as a fraction of health care spending, is associated with small improvements in potentially avoidable mortality and life expectancy. That means that relatively small increases in social spending, and corresponding decreases in health spending, could potentially improve population health with no change to overall provincial budgets. To draw this conclusion we considered other factors that might impact population health outcomes, like provincial gross domestic product, unemployment, population, and income inequality (among others).",,,

","Chagas disease (CD), caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is endemic in Latin America.  Primarily transmitted via the bite of triatomine insect vectors, in Canada the parasite can only spread via congenital transmission and infected blood transfusions or organ transplantation.  This report describes two Canadian-born siblings with asymptomatic indeterminate CD who were most likely congenitally infected and whose infections were incidentally uncovered.  This familial cluster of CD highlights the possibility of vertical transmission in Canada.  Blood donor screening will continue to uncover new cases of chronic CD.  All immigrants from Latin American countries with higher CD endemicity should be offered testing for CD.  Early treatment can prevent serious long term sequelae.  It is expected that Canadian physicians will increasingly uncover patients with CD and should therefore be informed about CD management. Our unexpected findings should allow all offspring (including adult children) of known CD-positive mothers to be screened for CD.",,,

Personalized care is the careful tailoring of investigations and therapies to individual patients based on evidence, consideration of circumstances and clinical skill and has long been the hallmark of good clinical care.  Precision Medicine relies on increasingly detailed molecular characterization of disease states using the biologic omics platforms (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc) to better individualize diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutics based on each patient s unique genetic and physiologic characteristics.

To help us understand how to prevent suicide, we linked population-based health administrative data with coroner death records (1994-2008) in Ontario, Canada to examine how often women die by suicide during pregnancy and in the 1st year after delivery, and what kinds of health services these women used prior to suicide. The suicide rate in pregnancy and postpartum was 2.58 per 100,000 live births. Suicide accounted for approximately 5% of deaths among pregnant and postpartum women. The most common time for suicide to occur was in the final quarter of the first postpartum year although deaths by suicide occurred throughout pregnancy and postpartum. The highest suicide rates were in rural and remote regions of the Province. Perinatal women were most likely to die from hanging (33%) or jumping/falling (20%); this differed from women who died by suicide non-perinatally where overdose was the most common cause of death. Only 39% of pregnant or postpartum women who died by suicide had contact with a mental health professional in the 30 days prior to suicide, although 40% had contact with an obstetrician, and 65% with a pediatric provider for their child. The suicide rate among pregnant and postpartum women is comparable to international estimates; death by suicide accounts for 1 in 20 deaths among pregnant or postpartum Canadian women.  Non-mental health care providers may be in an important position to actively assess for risk and direct women to appropriate interventions.  ",,,

Although it is typically diagnosed in adolescence, an increasing number of children under age 10 years are being diagnosed. In 2016, a child was diagnosed at the age of 4 years at the Diabetes Education Resource for Children and Adolescents in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. This child did not present to medical care due to the classic diabetes symptoms but rather he was tested for diabetes because he had a number of known risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes including being overweight, of a high-risk ethnic background, born to a mother with diabetes and having a family history of diabetes. This child was of Oji-Cree heritage which is a population that may be affected by a change in DNA that lowers the bodyÕs ability to secrete insulin. He was initially managed with lifestyle changes but a decline in his blood sugar control made insulin management necessary. This report shows the importance of testing for diabetes in children before puberty (< 10 years old) even if they are asymptomatic when they have multiple risk factors for diabetes. These children require treatment as without proper care and follow up the loss of blood sugar control happens quickly putting them at risk of early and late complications of diabetes.",,,

He also feels unwell from a fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle aches, and fatigue. His physician finds multiple inflamed joints and considers a broad list of causes. Some of these causes will resolve on their own with time, while other causes such as infections can be more serious and need immediate attention. Inflamed, swollen joints should be rapidly tested for infection by taking a sample of the joint fluid with a needle.
The patientÕs tests show bacteria in the fluid, meaning he has a joint infection. Although joint infections in general are not rare, this type of bacteria found is unusual because it comes from rats. The patient later says he has frequent contact with rats that he feeds to pet snakes. This disease is sometimes called Òrat-bite feverÓ, which is misleading because people can become infected without being bitten. Patients usually do well with antibiotic treatment.
The bacteria in Òrat-bite feverÓ do not necessarily enter joints to cause infection there, but inflammation occurs because of an over-activated immune system. If the bacteria do enter and infect the joints, then patients benefit from more aggressive therapy with antibiotics given intravenously, and possibly even surgery.
This case shows the importance for physicians to consider a wide range of causes when dealing with multiple inflamed joints. When suspecting an infection, physicians should aggressively test the joints, treat patients with antibiotics, and be aware of Òrat-bite feverÓ as a rare but important cause.

","The Canadian Ebola vaccine, known as VSV-EBOV, is an experimental vaccine still being evaluated in humans. It was developed by scientists at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, Canada. This vaccine does not contain Ebola virus; it consists of a genetically engineered and weakened vesicular stomatitis virus (an animal virus) that expresses a surface protein from the Ebola virus, and thereby stimulates an immune response targeted against Ebola virus when introduced into the body. Other clinical trials have tested this vaccine in healthy humans, but this is the first one to monitor volunteers and collect samples out to six months following administration of the vaccine thereby providing some new information around its long-term benefits, safety, and side effects. Three doses of VSV-EBOV were assessed in this study; none of the doses elicited any safety concerns, and side effects were generally mild to moderate. Recipients of all three doses showed a significant immune response when compared to a comparator group that did not receive the vaccine, with immune responses remaining high through to the six months assessments. This study is important in demonstrating that the vaccine is safe and effective in healthy adults and shows that the levels and length of protection offer promise that it will be beneficial in immunocompromised individuals and can very well be expanded for use in Ebola disease endemic areas in the near future.",,,

However, it is well described that post-operative pain management in children is suboptimal.

Given the advisories surrounding the use of codeine in children, oral morphine and other opioids are being increasingly prescribed. However, evidence guiding therapy is limited and studies have cited significant safety concerns. Our study is the first to explore the effectiveness of oral morphine for post-operative pain following ambulatory surgery in children. In children age 5-17 years who underwent minor ambulatory orthopedic surgery, we found that oral morphine was not superior to ibuprofen in relieving pain for the first 48 hours following discharge. Both agents produced a clinically significant decrease in pain but oral morphine was associated with significantly more side effects, most commonly drowsiness. This suggests ibuprofen, the safer analgesic choice, should be the first line option in children for mild to moderate post-operative pain at home. More than 90% of children experienced pain significant enough to require analgesia, underscoring the importance of adequate pain management, even following minor surgery.",,,

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of spine showed two lesions over posterior elements of T10 and L4, respectively and the T10 lesion compressed the spinal cord . He had an urgent surgical decompression of the T10 lesion which, on histology, was composed of round to spindled mononuclear cells and numerous osteoclast-type giant cells with some bony trabeculae. His neurologic deficits recovered two weeks after the operation. Because of pain in his left forearm he had an x-ray which also showed suspected brown tumors. Parathyroid scan (Tc-99m Sestamibi) and ultrasound suggested a right parathyroid adenoma which was confirmed on parathyroidectomy. Multiple spine brown tumors are rare compared to those found in the extremities, clavicle, ribs and pelvis.ÊNeurologic deÞcits caused by spinal brown tumors may be the Þrst symptoms of undiagnosed hyperparathyroidism. Brown tumours are often lytic, but can also be solid or mixed with fluid content. In patients presenting with lytic or solid spine lesions with fluid component, brown tumors should be included in the differential diagnosis together with a search for evidence of primary, secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism.",,,

The high levels of this hormone lead to high blood pressure that may be difficult to control with medications; in its most advanced phase, it may also cause low potassium levels in the blood.  According to the latest set of studies, this condition may be responsible for between 3 to 10% of the patients with high blood pressure seen in ""routine"" cases and between 10 to 20% of people whose high blood pressue is considered ""treatment resistant"".  Compared to other forms of high blood pressure, PA appears to pose especially high risks for heart disease and stroke complications in those who are affected by the condition.  Over the past 20 years, many studies from around the world have confirmed that this is not a rare disease and there are specific treatment options including aldosterone-blocking drugs or surgical removal of the adrenal glands which may be highly effective to control or even cure the disease.  With the high number of people in Canada affected by high blood pressure, this naturally means that there are potentially a large number of patients with undiagnosed PA as well.  The authors call for increased awareness of PA among primary care providers and encourage the more frequent use of a blood test called the Aldosterone-Renin-Ratio in order to better detect affected patients who have the most to benefit from such specific treatments.",,,

We present the story of a young woman with a history of heavy menstrual periods. This is a common and challenging clinical problem Ð because Òbleeding too muchÓ is a very subjective symptom. We remind care providers that some women with heavy periods have a blood condition that make them more likely to bleed and that often these conditions are missed by regular blood work (including commonly used coagulation tests).  We review some of these blood conditions and suggest an easy-to-use questionnaire that makes it easier for care providers to identify patients with abnormal bleeding. The questionnaire also helps clarify which patients need specialist care.   
  Importantly, the young woman in this article had normal blood coagulation tests but she had excessive bleeding that was flagged by the questionnaire. Her answers resulted in a referral to a specialist, who was able to identify that she had a genetic condition that affected her bloodÕs ability to clot normally.  The doctor gave her medicine to control her bleeding and improve her day-to-day life.

With a prevalence of 5% in Canada CRS is a very common but sometimes poorly recognized disease. The clinical recognition of CRS can be a challenge due to the overlap of some its symptoms with other diseases, including allergic rhinitis, as the symptom spectrum for patients with CRS include nasal congestion, facial pain and pressure, nasal obstruction, nasal discharge or rhinorrhea and a complete or diminished sense of smell. The importance of diagnosing CRS is related to its impairment patient quality of life and loss of productivity both of which are modifiable with CRS specific treatment. This emphasizes the need to correctly identify patients with CRS and to institute appropriate management to optimize CRS symptom control. 

The case of a 22-year-old patient with a diminished sense of smell and nasal congestion for 6 months is used to present the evidence guiding the evaluation and initial management for such a patient. Guidance for the selective use of computed tomography (CT) imaging of the paranasal sinuses is provided. The mainstay of treatment for patients with CRS remains the daily use of an intranasal corticosteroid spray which is commonly supplemented with daily home saline irrigation, oral antibiotic therapy and a short course of oral corticosteroids when necessary. Although many patients can be managed with medical therapy alone some patients may require referral to an otolaryngologist for the consideration of surgical management.

AutoHCT has been used for decades for patients with certain cancers, particularly lymphoma. Only recently, autoHCT has been shown to be beneficial also for patients with systemic sclerosis. AutoHCT is usually performed in cancer centers. The first challenge for the Canadian health care system is that cancer centers may be reluctant to care for patients with systemic sclerosis without additional funding to ensure adequate care for these patients. The second challenge for the Canadian health care system is the provincial funding model. Most provinces have their own transplant programs, and residents of each province are expected to receive transplants in their own province. However, for rare diseases like systemic sclerosis, only a few teams are needed that would maintain skills and expertise, eg, one in Western and one in Eastern Canada.

More than 80% of strokes are caused by a blockage of a brain artery, leading to lack of blood flow to parts of the brain (ischemic stroke). A person may lose the ability of to move one side of the body, the ability to speak and see normally, or a number of other symptoms. The sooner the treatment starts, the better the recovery. ÒTime is brainÓ. The proper treatment of stroke depends on finding out the type of stroke. For patients with ischemic stroke, the aim of treatment is to reopen the clogged artery as quickly as possible. The current standard treatments are intravenous clot buster medication (Alteplase) and intra-arterial removal of the clot (thrombectomy) by a stent-retriever device performed in an angio suite.  The clot buster medication (Alteplase) is injected though a vein and it acts by dissolving the clot. Intra-arterial thrombectomy is performed in the angio suite by using a catheter containing a small metallic stent (stent-retriever), which acts by capturing and removing the clot blocking the large artery. Both these treatments can be beneficial if these were given within few hours of stroke onset. However, even with the high success rates seen after standard stent-retriever mechanical thrombectomy, nearly one-third of patients are left without adequate reopening of the blocked artery. Here, we describe simultaneous application of two stent-retrievers for removal of clot after failed single stent-retriever thrombectomy. ",,,

Many of these prescriptions are inappropriate, and expose patients to avoidable risks of allergy, side effects, Clostridium difficile infection and antibiotic resistant bacteria.  In this Ontario-wide study of nearly 1700 doctors prescribing  to more than 93,000 long term care residents, we found that antibiotic prescription decisions were driven more by who was prescribing the antibiotic than by who was receiving it.  The decision to start an antibiotic, the choice of which antibiotic to use, and the length of the prescription were all subject to prescriber habit.  A prescriberÕs historical antibiotic prescribing behaviour was a strong predictor of their current antibiotic decision-making, even after accounting for the characteristics of the patients they were treating, including age, gender, comorbid  illnesses, functional status and indwelling devices.  Extreme high outlier prescribers tended to remain extreme high or high outliers the next year.  Since antibiotic prescribers seem to have individual tendencies towards antibiotic initiation, selection of specific drugs, and use of prolonged treatment duration, audit-and-feedback to prescribers may be a promising tool to improve antibiotic use in long-term care.

","Patients who wait longer to have certain emergency surgeries, especially hip fracture surgery, are thought to have an increased risk of bad outcomes after surgery. Whether the relationship between longer wait times and bad outcomes for emergency surgery patients applies to all types of emergency surgery (excluding cardiac surgery) is not known. 
At the Ottawa Hospital, a new and more detailed system to grade the urgency of surgery and to set acceptable wait times for surgeries was implemented. Following implementation of this system, we studied whether patients who did not have their emergency surgery within an acceptable wait time were more likely to die after surgery, stayed longer in hospital, or cost more to care for after surgery.
After taking into account differences between patients who had surgery Ôon timeÕ compared to patients who had their surgery delayed, we found that patients who didnÕt have their emergency surgery within the acceptable wait time were more likely to die after surgery, stayed longer in hospital and were more expensive to care for. Furthermore, most documented reasons for patients not having surgery on time were related to a lack of available operating rooms, doctors and nurses. We estimate that for every 60 patients who have delayed emergency surgery, one would die because of delay. Current data suggests that about 20% of patients wait too long for emergency surgery. This could translate into over 400 deaths in Canada every year being caused by delayed emergency surgery.

Twitter: @Sunnybrook 
2. Facebook: @SunnybrookHSC "," Neuroendocrine tumors, formerly called carcinoid tumors, are a unique group of cancers which arise from neuroendocrine cells.  Neuroendocrine tumors can occur almost anywhere in the body, but are most commonly found in the lung, small bowel and pancreas. These tumors are best known for their ability to produce hormones, such as serotonin, which can result in a constellation of symptoms called the carcinoid syndrome.  The carcinoid syndrome is characterized by symptoms such as flushing, diarrhea, wheezing and damage to heart valves. While neuroendocrine tumors are classically thought of as slow growing cancers associated with long life-expectancies, they also have the potential to be very aggressive and can be associated with survival measured in months. 

Recent research has shown that their incidence of neuroendocrine tumors has markedly risen in Canada over the past 15 years. Along with the rise in the incidence of neuroendocrine tumors, there has been a steady increase in the amount and quality of research to determine the best diagnostic and treatment options for neuroendocrine tumors. 

This review summarizes the classification, presentation and initial diagnostic workup of neuroendocrine tumors with the aim of helping generalists facilitate timely diagnosis and referral. This review also highlights the expanding therapeutic treatment options that allow many patients with neuroendocrine tumors, even those with metastatic disease, to enjoy long periods of well-controlled symptoms and an excellent quality of life.
