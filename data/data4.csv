In some circumstances it may also lead to help seeking behavior.  There is limited evidence for which specific characteristics of media reports mediate these phenomena and there is little Canadian research on the topic.  This study examined the relationship between potentially harmful and helpful elements of print and online media reports about suicide in 13 major publications in the Toronto media market and suicide deaths in Toronto (2011-2014).  Specifically, it assessed for a link between specific types of reporting and suicide deaths within the 7 days after publication.  It found that from 2011-2014, there were 6,367 articles with suicide as the major focus.  There were 947 suicide deaths in Toronto over the same period.  Elements most strongly, independently associated with increased suicides were a statement that suicide is inevitable, articles about asphyxia other than by hanging or car exhaust, about suicide by jumping from a building, about suicide pacts and that included the suicide method in the headline.  Elements most strongly, independently associated with decreased suicides were negative judgments about the deceased within the article, articles about railway and cutting/stabbing deaths, and about murder-suicide.  This large study identified significant associations between several specific elements of media reports and suicide deaths.  It suggests that reporting on suicide can have a meaningful impact on suicide deaths and that journalists and media outlets/organizations should carefully consider the specific content of reports prior to publication.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His name is Yousef. He suffers from terrible disfigurement as a result of a chemical mortar that was dropped in Mosul in 2015. A sulphur mustard gas explosion was the culprit and he continues to endure significant keloid scarring to his head and neck, which of course now produces more emotional pain than other forms. He is eleven and gets teased by other children because of the way he looks. He has attempted suicide three times. And for now, he has been rescued by family three times. I learned about Yousef my first days in mission and quite honestly the story gutted me. I told my colleague immediately that “this story needs to be heard”. Its audience needs to know that these deplorable acts are not that uncommon. This is a crime of humanity and in my opinion, it is being allowed by the global community.

I intentionally wanted to mislead the reader—at least on their first pass through—about the true diagnosis of the subject. I want the poem to probe the reader’s perceptions about mental illness: once the reader discovers that the true diagnosis is mental illness rather than cancer, does it change your appreciation for the severity of the problem? Does it make you feel less concerned with the subject’s affliction or attitudes? Does it feel disrespectful to cancer patients? Most of all: what causes us to feel this way? For an institution that prides itself for taking care of patients, we don’t always take the best care of ourselves. Worse, we encourage the same bad habits to manifest in others. The substance use, the signs of physical and mental strain, we all know it’s there and yet it’s so hard to combat. The culture of medicine itself disables us: the idea that admitting our humanity makes us weak, the length and depth of training required, the perpetual stress of fighting a medical system to give our patients what we know they need. You have all been medical students and interns. You’ve been here. Talk about your struggle. Advocate for better practices in medical education.

Google Plus: plus.google.com/+JeremyHowick,"In many randomised trials, participants are given either a placebo or a ‘real’ treatment (and they usually aren’t supposed to know which is which). Then, if people who received the ‘real’ treatment improve more than the people who received the placebo, the researchers can say that the real treatment ‘works’. But all this means that placebo controls have to be a good control, and sometimes they are not. We often think of placebo controls in trials as simple, but they come in different shapes and sizes, have different ingredients, and range from fake pills and injections to fake surgery. And different placebos can have different effects on patients. For example, studies show that many placebos don’t appear similar enough to the ‘real’ treatments they are supposed to imitate. If they don’t, then participants in the trial will know they are taking a placebo, and could drop out of the trial or have lower expectations (thinking ‘I’m not going to get better because I’m just taking the placebo’). These lower expectations can lead to worse outcomes in some trials  - such as in those of drugs for treating pain or depression. In this article, we discuss these and other examples of placebo controls that are not good controls. To know whether a placebo control is a good control or not, we need to know all the components of it. Unfortunately, most trials don’t tell us these details. This means that we can’t sure how much the treatment that is being trialled actually helps or harms people. This articles shows that all of the people involved in doing trials need to fully describe the components of the placebo control being used so that we have accurate research to inform decisions about treatments.",,,,,0,,,,,,,,96,

I had done all I could to keep him alive, and although he wanted me to provide a pill for the end, I couldn’t do that . Although his wishes were clear, in the end we could not do more than get him into a hospice for end of life care and discontinue his medications. It raises the point that we may have firm ideas about how we want to die, but the reality of instituting such wishes is much more difficult when that person is no longer in mental control. I suggest that we use media to build a clear picture of what we want and don’t want, so that when doctors and health care providers meet us at our worst, they can access that media and see what we wanted when we were at our best. Not everyone gets an end of life diagnosis that allows one to be sentient right to the end, diseases that rob the mind cause difficulties for caregivers when determining end of life decisions.",,,,,0,,,,,,,,83,

He underwent endovascular management with placement of self expandable stent.BCS occurs secondary to in-situ vascular thrombosis, extrinsic compression by adjacent tumor or its invasion, and idiopathic membranous obstruction. The membranous or the short segment obstruction of the IVC is the common variety in Asia. In western country thrombotic obstruction is the common cause. The typical triad of BCS is abdominal pain, hepatomegaly and ascites. The clinical presentation of BCS depends on the extent and rapidity of the hepatic-vein occlusion. Doppler ultrasound is the initial investigation of choice. Other investigatory modalities include contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The mode of management varies according to the extent of disease and anatomical variety of BCS. Medical therapy consists of diuretic therapy to control ascites and anticoagulation therapy for prevention of thrombus extension. The relief of venous outflow obstruction can be done with techniques like percutaneous thrombolysis, venous angioplasty with or without stenting, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt and surgical shunts. Liver transplantation may be needed in rare instances.",,,,,0,14,1,9,3,0,0,,49,

He was treated with topical ketoconazole cream for 2 weeks without any improvement. Physical examination showed redness and fine scaling on the glans penis. Fungal cultures of scrapings from the glans were negative. Skin biopsy showed parakeratosis, Munro microabscesses, and acanthosis in the epidermis, which were consistent with psoriasis vulgaris. The patient received tacrolimus 0.1% ointment twice daily and the lesions were resolved after 3 weeks. He then applied it twice weekly, which prolonged flare-free interval for six months.Up to 63% of psoriasis patients have genital involvement. But psoriasis limited to the glans penis is rare, affecting only 2-5% of psoriasis patients. Patients may experience poor quality of life and sexual repression. They usually lack the typical presentation of psoriasis, which more often leads to misdiagnosis as other inflammatory diseases or, more importantly, sexually transmitted infections. Glans psoriasis is difficult to treat as glans skin is very thin and sensitive. The first-line topical agents for psoriasis vulgaris, such as corticosteroids and calcipotriol, are not suited to glans psoriasis due to their local side reactions. Topical tacrolimus, an immunosuppressant, is significantly effective and has good tolerability for inverse psoriasis on face, genitals, and intertriginous areas. Therefore, it may be more suited to a patient with chronic or recurrent glans psoriasis. ",,,,,0,36,1,1,,,,,63,

Major outbreaks occurred in numerous Canadian provinces in the early 2000s. This national multicentre study describes the evolution of healthcare-associated CDI in Canada over a seven-year period (2009-2015) in a network of 64 acute care hospitals that participated in the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program (CNISP). Over that period of time, there was a 27% reduction in the rate of CDI across Canada and significant changes in C. difficile strains circulating in hospitals. CDI caused by the NAP1 strain, previously implicated in many of the most significant outbreaks, was associated with higher mortality. While the NAP1 strain remains the dominant strain, it has become much less common and is being replaced by other strains. The authors note that for every 10% change in the proportion of the NAP1 strain among all strains at any individual hospital, the institutional rate of CDI acquired by patients changed by 3.3%.",17,8,26,80,9,34,9,11,2,,,,97,
